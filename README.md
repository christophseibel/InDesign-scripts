# InDesign-scripts

randomgrid.jsx:
this script allows you to generate a random (but rule based) grid on the active page.
to use it simply center the page you want to work on and open the script. 
the script will select the current page but you can still change it to another page. additionally you have the option to increase the gapsize of your grid
you then have two options to choose from. you either generate a new grid which will overwrite the old one or you just clear the current page
